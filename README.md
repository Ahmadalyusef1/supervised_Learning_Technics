# Image Classification with CNNs on CIFAR-10

## Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The model is built with TensorFlow/Keras and trained to classify images into 10 categories (e.g., airplanes, cars, birds).

## Key Features
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 (50,000 training images, 10,000 test images, 10 classes).
- **Model Architecture**: CNN with:
  - Convolutional layers (feature extraction).
  - Pooling layers (dimensionality reduction).
  - Fully connected layers (classification).
- **Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on labeled data to predict image classes.

## Code Structure
- **Data Loading**: Load and preprocess CIFAR-10 data.
- **Visualization**: Display sample images from the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Define and train the CNN using TensorFlow.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance on test data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## Results
- Achieved accuracy: [X]% on test data (replace with your result).
- Example predictions visualized for model interpretability.

## Why It Matters
Demonstrates proficiency in:
- **Deep Learning**: CNN architecture design.
- **Computer Vision**: Image classification tasks.
- **Supervised Learning**: Leveraging labeled data for training.
